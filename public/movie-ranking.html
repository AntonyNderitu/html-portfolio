<h1>The Best Movies According to Antony</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I loved this movie because it depicted our society for what it is and how repeated failures in our institutions that ought to safeguard the people and their interest, have left people, vulnerable, bitter & gullible.</p>

<h3>Flight of the Navigator</h3>
<p>Childhood favourite that inspired dreams of space travel and adventure.</p>

<h3>Yakee Zulu</h3>
<p>Funniest movie and a mirror narrative of my Childhood games and mischief.</p>
